					<description><![CDATA[We&#8217;ve become more and more fixated on the aspect of social media we find most personally pernicious: the time-sink, the way an infinite scroll can lead to two hours down the drain with nothing to show for it but that ate-too-much-movie-popcorn feeling. Simultaneously, Alex has been dealing with some sleep issues over the past month or two (and would guess a lot of people have)!

					<description><![CDATA[I. Introduction For 25 consecutive business days, four times per year, about 17,000 players from all over the world gather online in the LearnedLeague, a private digital trivia competition. Each day’s match pairs players head-to-head, mostly with strangers, to answer a series of six difficult general knowledge questions. The goal is to win as many matches as possible in a given season. For this privilege, players pay $30 per year, after a free introductory season. [&#8230;]]]></description>
