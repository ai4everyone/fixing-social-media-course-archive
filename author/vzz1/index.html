<h6 class="has-secondary-color has-text-color has-text-align-center"><em><strong>NOTE: I have left all names in screenshots as the South End Community Board is a public, visible group on facebook.</strong></em></h6>



<p>It’s hard to ignore the growth of Facebook Groups, whether you’re
an active Facebook user or just a lucky consumer of the widespread <a href="https://s3-prod.adage.com/inline-images/20190502_In_Situ-Press.jpg">“More
Together”</a> <a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/facebook-takes-steps-toward-rebuilding-trust-campaign-under-new-cmo-antonio-lucio/2168956">ad
campaign</a>. As of April 2019, more than 400 million people were in groups
that they found meaningful (as determined by Facebook through surveys and
engagement metrics).<a href="index.html#_ftn1">[1]</a>
It would appear that up to 6,000 of those people are members of the South End
Community Board (SECB), a lively Facebook Group dedicated to the South End
neighborhood of Boston.</p>



<p>To a casual participant (like the author, who has used the
group… twice… to see if anyone found her podless AirPod case on a sidewalk),
SECB seems like a fairly healthy online community thanks to adherence to the
posted guidelines, the helpful or humorous tone of most posts, and member
engagement. Yet, like any healthy community, not all exchanges are completely
“positive” nor is SECB immune to exogenous shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic.
As coronavirus spreads across Boston and the world, does a neighborhood
Facebook Group need to adapt, and if so, how?</p>



<h4><strong>Background</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>South End Community Board</em></strong></p>



<p>SECB was created as a Facebook Group by Stephen (Steve) Fox on
April 25, 2015. The group is visible and public, meaning anyone can find the
group and see who’s in the group and what they post (including comments on
others’ posts) – no Facebook login necessary. As of March 29, 2020, the group
had 6,310 members, 62 of which had joined within the past week. Membership
included two admins and 33 Facebook Pages, most of which represented local
businesses and politicians. The other group members were presumed to be
individuals living and/or working in the South End. While Facebook does not
provide a dashboard for group members, a sample of the member list reflected a
college-educated majority and a notable concentration of educators and health care
workers.</p>



<p><strong><em>Steve Fox</em></strong></p>



<p>Fox has lived in the South End since the late 1980s. He has
long been active in the community, co-founding the South End Forum in 2002 as
an umbrella for the 17 distinct neighborhood and business associations that
advocate for the South End.<a href="index.html#_ftn2">[2]</a>
In addition to administering and moderating SECB, Fox serves as chairman of the
South End Forum and advisor to Friends of the South End Library.</p>



<p><strong><em>South End neighborhood</em></strong></p>



<p>The South End is a one-square mile neighborhood of Boston
with 31,669 residents as of the 2010 U.S. Census.<a href="index.html#_ftn3">[3]</a>
This suggests up to 20% of residents were SECB members as of March 2020, though
the actual share is likely lower given the number of non-person and
non-resident members and even accounting for population inflow since 2010. Compared
to the city of Boston overall, South End residents as of 2015 were more likely
to be white (55% vs. 45% for the city), more highly educated (65% with
bachelor’s degree or higher vs. 45%), and earn more ($77,161 median household
income vs. $55,777).<a href="index.html#_ftn4">[4]</a>
Today, the neighborhood is just one example of rapid gentrification as <a href="https://boston.eater.com/2019/1/3/18166783/no-relation-sushi-omakase-shore-leave-south-end-boston">high-end</a>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/South_End_Planning_District_Profile_tcm3-13007.pdf"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SouthEndMap.png" alt="map of south end, boston" class="wp-image-484" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SouthEndMap.png 650w, ../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SouthEndMap-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></figure></div>



<h4><strong>How SECB Operates</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong></p>



<p>As stated in the group’s description, SECB exists as, “A
respectful and open discussion area for Boston&#8217;s South End residents and
neighbors on just about any matter of interest, opinion, or community public
notice.”<a href="index.html#_ftn5">[5]</a>
Topics vary widely but follow exhaustive guidelines / posted etiquette, which
are strictly enforced by the two group admins. Recent memorable postings
included an ask for a spare 3V CR1225 battery (the kind that fits most digital
thermometers), an update on which stores have toilet paper in stock, and an
offer for no-contact dog walking.</p>



<p><strong><em>Guidelines</em></strong></p>



<p>Like most of today’s online communities, SECB operates under
guidelines that encourage healthy activity. The guidelines are clearly posted
in the group’s description and are updated sparingly. A notable change was made
following a steady increase in members posting screenshots or video clips from
their Ring doorbells (or similar surveillance), after which Fox added, “Because
video can be a valuable tool to help police to identify and potentially arrest
individuals for criminal activity, we ask Board members to send any video or
photographic footage that might help the police to ID a suspect quickly and
directly to the BPD [Boston Police Department].” In addition, as SECB is a
public group, members likely (or should) think twice before posting,
commenting, or reacting, as their activity is visible and identifiable to
anyone with Internet access.</p>



<p>Two specific guidelines that this Craigslist love-hating
author particularly appreciated were 1) no “veiled or outright” ads, except for
real estate for lease or sale by current occupant or owner, and 2) “members
posting any for sale items MUST include price.” </p>



<p><strong><em>Ongoing challenges</em></strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-thumbnail"><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-ongoingchallenge-cited.png"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-ongoingchallenge-cited-150x150.png" alt="" class="wp-image-494" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Even with a comprehensive set of guidelines, online
communities are prone to occasionally go off the rails. While having just two
groups admins made it easier to be consistent in how SECB is moderated, it also
meant the board only has two people as checkpoints on potential misinformation,
misrepresentation, or other miscellaneous nastiness. Especially with the
tremendous uptick in posts – 81 on March 19, 2020 versus 7 for the week of
March 12-19, 2019 – Fox and his co-admin faced a growing fight against SECB
activity that violated posted guidelines.</p>



<p><strong><em>Competitors </em></strong></p>



<p>SECB is one of many neighborhood-specific Facebook Groups
and faces additional competition on other platforms, including <a href="https://www.theroot.com/the-racist-nextdoor-1835939264">Nextdoor</a>. However,
SECB seems to dominate in size and overall activity thanks to its broad
purpose. Other publicly visible groups are more interest-specific, such as Buy
Nothing South End, Boston, MA (594 members, 50 posts in last 30 days), Boston
South End Parents (553 members, 37 posts in last 30 days), and South End Young
Professionals (188 members, 54 posts in last 30 days).</p>



<h4><strong>Measuring Digital
Community Health</strong></h4>



<p>The following metrics were used to evaluate the online
health of SECB:</p>



<ul><li>Member activity: Volume of posts and comments served
as an important reflection of how much members were engaging with content. A
bulletin board could be evaluated with read-only metrics, but with a community
discussion, it felt important to understand how much people were adding their
own input.</li><li>Tone of posts: Facebook’s built-in “reactions”
were sorted into three rough categories – “positive” included Love❤️ and Haha😂,
“neutral” included Like👍 &nbsp;and Wow😮,
and “negative” included Sad😢
and Angry😡. These reactions
were used as a proxy for the tone of each post, which would otherwise have been
subjectively evaluated by the author. Reactions were also an additional gauge
of member activity.</li><li>Breadth of topics: Posts were tagged to
categories as applicable, including those seeking something, those offering
something, purely informational posts, and discussion-opening posts. Seeking
and offering posts were mutually exclusive, but other category combinations
were allowed, e.g. discussion-opening and informational, offering something and
informational, or seeking something and discussion-opening (provided the
discussion was about something besides what the original author was looking
for, such as a restaurant recommendation).</li><li>Breadth of authorship: Posts were categorized
based on authorship by a business vs. an individual, and grouped to determine
the number of unique authors in a given timeframe.</li><li>Truthiness: Posts were labeled “truthy” if they

<p>COVID-19 escalated in local importance beginning March 5,
2020, when the first Biogen conference infection was reported, and was declared
a pandemic on March 11. To capture a before and after comparison while
minimizing seasonal variability, metrics were gathered for the week of March
12-19, 2019 and for the day of March 19, 2020 (original intention was to collect
metrics for the entire week in 2020 as well, but there proved to be too many
posts for this to be feasible).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-data-249x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-485" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-data-249x300.png 249w, ../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-data.png 658w" sizes="(max-width: 249px) 100vw, 249px" /></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Pre-pandemic</em></strong> </p>



<p>SECB in March 2019 was a pleasant enough place to be: with
just 7 posts for the week, but a healthy 4.29 comments per post on average and
only 7% negative reactions, members seemed to be engaging positively with each
other. An impressive 86% of posts were “truthy”. Unfortunately for the burden
on SECB admins, there were only two unique authors during the week in question,
and Fox was one of them.</p>



<p><strong><em>During pandemic</em></strong></p>



<p>Fast-forward to March 2020, and SECB had become a different
place, as had most news and media channels. While overall posts jumped to 81 in
just one day, member engagement kept up with 4.86 comments per post on average.
Reactions increased substantially, from an average of 4.14 per post
pre-pandemic to 12.9 per post on March 19, 2020. The tone of reactions also
became more neutral or negative, from 28% down to 17% “positive” and 7% up to
11% “negative”. Unfortunately, share of “truthy” posts went down substantially
to 52% – likely related to the increase in number of unique authors, many of
whom were more casual posters than Fox (though none of the posts appeared to be
clearly “fake news”).</p>



<p>On the brighter side for overall community health, the
pandemic period saw an increase in people offering something, from 0% up to 6%,
and a consistent flow of informational posts, from 29% up to 54%. There was
also an impressive increase in author diversity, with 40 unique members posting
in just one day. Discussion-opening posts also remained fairly constant, from
14% to 10%, which is a positive reflection of how members continue to turn to
SECB to have a variety of open conversations, regardless of a global crisis.</p>

<h4><strong>Planning for the future</strong></h4>



<p><strong><em>New and anticipated challenges</em></strong></p>



<p><em>Pressure on health care workers:</em> South End is home to Boston Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital and Level I trauma center in New England according to Wikipedia. Its proximity to Boston University, Northeastern University, and Longwood Medical Area also makes it a popular neighborhood for current / future / past health care professionals. As COVID-19 continues to spread in Boston, Fox should anticipate further changes in the tone of SECB based on the needs of local residents and businesses.</p>



<p><em>Reliance on hospitality industry:</em> While many restaurants in the South End have remained open for take-out and delivery only, even more have completely shut down their operations with no clear path to re-opening. Much of the neighborhood’s economy relies on locally-owned restaurants and retail stores, which suffer most in a time of social distancing and e-commerce domination. Fox should anticipate that customers, employees, and managers of local shops will take to SECB to seek help and support.</p>



<p><em>Slowdown in real estate development:</em> South End real estate prices have risen impressively, to the chagrin of many long-timers, and were expected to continue their upward trajectory based on a number of high-end developments under way. While the long-term impact of COVID-19 is impossible to predict, it is likely that a broader economic softening will lead to less active real estate markets. Many of the more contentious SECB posts in the past have related to new developments, so this may actually be a win for Fox in that he will not have to deal with as much negativity, but also poses an additional threat to the neighborhood’s economic liveliness.</p>



<p><strong><em>Choices to consider</em></strong></p>



<p>The easiest thing for Fox to do is stick with the status quo.
There is nothing alarming in the health metrics examined, and certainly nothing
in particular that demands an immediate change in how SECB operates.</p>



<p>The risk with doing what’s always been done, however, is that
SECB misses an opportunity to go above and beyond. As many people have said in
the past weeks, “never waste a good crisis”. Fox could, for example, double-down
on Facebook’s existing effort to bring more coronavirus-related updates into
every section of Facebook, including Group pages. SECB could become a place that
follows up on and emphasizes the latest local / state / federal directives,
which it already does to some extent through informational postings, but not systematically.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-thumbnail"><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-covid.png"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2020/03/SECB-covid-150x150.png" alt="" class="wp-image-488" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Finally, Fox could take a leap and reframe SECB as an
opportunity to step up in local leadership. The group could be used as a way to
connect entrepreneurs, organize volunteers, and/or orchestrate legislative initiatives,
all in response to COVID-19 (and potentially future relevant challenges). This
would mean a substantial departure from the group’s current format, but if done
well, would also make the most of an already-healthy online community.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>BOARD POSTING GUIDELINES/ETIQUETTE:</p><p>A respectful and open discussion area for Boston&#8217;s South End residents and neighbors on just about any matter of interest, opinion, or community public notice.</p><p>Veiled or outright advertising posts, including for rent and other real estate purchase offerings&#8211;unless by the current owner or lessee&#8211;are not made to this Board since they could quickly overwhelm through sheer numbers. We encourage timely announcements of city or other service opportunities, events, new business openings, fund-raisers or community events likely to be of interest to South Enders.</p><p>South End businesses that wish to provide an occasional notice of a limited offer, a thank-you &#8220;deal&#8221;, or holiday event &#8220;special&#8221; targeted specifically to South End neighbors may do so as an informative neighborhood public notice rather than routine advertising of the business or &#8220;today&#8217;s pasta special.&#8221; Notices by SE businesses, non-profits, neighborhood organizations or individual neighbors of charitable events or sponsorship opportunities are always welcome on the Board. Members posting any for sale items MUST include price.</p><p>This is especially a place to thoughtfully discuss new ideas that will help the South End continue to be the most welcoming neighborhood in the city.</p><p>Board posts should always demonstrate a basic respect for all members, for the broad South End community, and for those who might be unknowingly identified either through language or images. We ask that posters show both restraint and courtesy by refraining from insensitive or insulting commentary, accusation, or clearly hostile suggestions.</p><p>Posts that seem deliberately designed to needle, insult, poke someone in the eye, shame, bully, start a fight, troll, or employ offensive or insulting language are not welcome. While this is a public Board, a poster&#8217;s right to express what they want ends where other members&#8217; and posters&#8217; rights begin. The key is to consistently show simple respect.</p><p>POSTING PHOTOS OR VIDEO OF SUSPECTED CRIMINAL ACTIVITY:</p><p>Because video can be a valuable tool to help police to identify and potentially arrest individuals for criminal activity, we ask Board members to send any video or photographic footage that might help the police to ID a suspect quickly and directly to the BPD.</p><p>If you witness, capture, or experience a criminal act, immediately report it to 911. The police cannot investigate or take actions to ID suspect unless a report is made. Tell the police you have video or stills and provide it to them as part of your report.</p><p>DO NOT POST these videos here in the mistaken belief that alerting your neighbors, will somehow help to locate a suspect. Even if another neighbor happens to see a person in a posted video and reports it to the police, the police are limited in how they can respond without probable cause, with no suspect description, no actionable complaint.</p><cite><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SouthEndCB/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/SouthEndCB/</a></cite></blockquote>

<p>For my media diary, I chose to track all of my consumption of media that were <em>readable or audible artifacts intended to be seen or heard outside of 1-1 communications</em> (i.e. iMessages were not counted, but email newsletters were). From there, I translated each hour (roughly) of my media consumption into a one-count movement fundamental, so that each day could be represented with three eight-counts of dance. I chose to perform my dance to the accompaniment of only a metronome to keep the focus on the movements, which are encoded as follows:</p>



<ul><li>Gazing down = sleep time</li><li>Gazing up = awake but not actively mediated, such as while sitting in class, skiing with friends, or just talking to real live people!</li><li>Head movements = passive listening or reading, such as background music / TV or ads in the T station</li><li>Arm movements = voluntary, entertainment-focused listening or reading, such as scrolling through Twitter or listening to a podcast</li><li>Leg movements = less voluntary, utilitarian listening or reading, such as looking up walking directions or reading a restaurant menu</li><li>Movements of both arms indicate media multi-tasking, such as watching Netflix while checking Instagram</li></ul>



<p>Finally, I sped up my video into a more digestible loop. I chose not to represent my mix of digital vs. printed media consumption because it was almost all digital, except for on day 1 which was also my phone-free day, but wish I had found a creative way to incorporate that into my visuals as well.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m (un?)lucky enough to have already spent a recent day without my phone &#8211; left in the backseat of an Uber and turned off within minutes of my disembarkation &#8211; so I felt like a relative phone-free pro going into this assignment. Before I turned off my phone on Wednesday night, I already knew which apps would be most usable from my laptop vs. iPad, and to enable iMessage from my email instead of just my phone number. In a sign of Apple&#8217;s dominance in my life, I set my morning alarm on my iPad (feeling a little sad I was losing one night of sleep tracking from my usual iPhone app) then charged my Apple Watch (to be swapped out with my usual analog watch so that I&#8217;d have something to track my steps). Finally, I reminded my partner that I&#8217;d be without my phone all day so he needed to just trust I&#8217;d show up to our off-peak Valentine&#8217;s Day date on time.</p>



<p>For most of the day, I felt fine, and in ways, more free. I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m not &#8220;addicted&#8221; to my phone since I wasn&#8217;t reaching for it out of habit and I didn&#8217;t crave any particular use of it. I did, however, miss key elements of <strong>certainty</strong> and <strong>distraction</strong>.</p>



<h4><strong>On certainty &#8211; </strong></h4>



<p>I had a 7:15am workout class booked for Thursday morning, and while I&#8217;d been to this particular studio before, I wasn&#8217;t sure how long the walk would be. Usually, I would have checked on my phone en route, but instead I had to check on my iPad while I was still on my home WiFi. After class, I wanted to grab a smoothie at one of the cafes I knew was near the studio, but couldn&#8217;t remember any in particular, couldn&#8217;t look it up since I was phoneless, and decided to just get on the T to school instead of (gasp!) asking any humans around me.</p>



<p>I had a few moments like this throughout the day, doing weird things I wasn&#8217;t used to, just because I didn&#8217;t have instant access to online information. I could have guesstimated the walking distance myself, and I could have just wandered one block to find a smoothie. Instead, I feel like I gave up &#8211; like when I didn&#8217;t have my phone on me, I became this somewhat useless person who refused to use resources unless they were on a smartphone screen.</p>



<h4>On distraction &#8211;</h4>



<p>I lost count of the number of times I wanted my phone on me just so I could either read (Twitter or email newsletters) or listen to something (especially since I was in the middle of <em>Memoirs of a Geisha</em> on audiobook.) Instead, I read&#8230; anything I could. Whether by luck or something else, I carried a lot of reading with me on Thursday. I read the actual newspaper, which I get every day but usually just skim, and learned about how Puerto Rico lost millions in an email phishing scam. I read a book that&#8217;s been in my backpack since 2019. I read the estimated time of arrival signs in the T stop way more often than I usually do, and it made time feel like it was moving more slowly. I read the ads in the T stop and finally learned about the weekend Red Line construction. I read  posters and digital signage across MIT and realized there really is too much going on across campus.</p>



<p>I realized how bad I am at being bored, at allowing myself to just stare / zone out and think. I wanted to have something in front of my face, or in my ears, the whole day. I didn&#8217;t mind that it couldn&#8217;t be my phone, and I was lucky to have other distractions with me to keep my brain occupied, observing, intaking rather than mulling. <strong>This is the worst part about my relationship with my phone</strong> &#8211; the way it distracts me when I&#8217;m not with other people (and even sometimes when I am with other people). I think my partner and I were both secretly thrilled when I showed up to dinner still phoneless, the two of us forced to purely enjoy each other&#8217;s company over tacos and ghost pepper margaritas.</p>



<h4>Bonus thoughts</h4>



<p>One &#8220;good&#8221; thing I missed about my phone usage was taking photos. I love capturing small moments of joy, especially food, sometimes for myself and sometimes for social media. It&#8217;s just a convenience that decent cameras are now embedded in smartphones, and I think if I had a compact digital camera in addition to my phone, I&#8217;d be happier to leave my data-connected phone at home more often and just have a camera on me.</p>



<p>Another positive about phones is the ease with which we can intentionally connect with other people. I had the strongest urge to text my partner when I was on my way to dinner. I still can&#8217;t pinpoint why, but I felt that urge from the moment I stepped off campus to the moment I walked into the restaurant. I wanted him to know where I was, that I was thinking of him, and a little to know he was thinking of me (based on whether he responded to my text). I&#8217;m not sure this is a good thing &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s another sign of my dependence on my phone &#8211; but it gave me some hope about our phones as contributors to strong interpersonal relationships, and not just a crutch for modern, digitally mediated interactions. </p>



<p>Overall, I&#8217;d give the phone-free experience 4/5 stars. Worth a try, but probably not for everyone.</p>
