					<description><![CDATA[NOTE: I have left all names in screenshots as the South End Community Board is a public, visible group on facebook. It’s hard to ignore the growth of Facebook Groups, whether you’re an active Facebook user or just a lucky consumer of the widespread “More Together” ad campaign. As of April 2019, more than 400 million people were in groups that they found meaningful (as determined by Facebook through surveys and engagement metrics).[1] It would [&#8230;]]]></description>
