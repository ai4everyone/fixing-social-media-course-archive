					<description><![CDATA[The algorithms that social media and search engines use to elevate news stories are opaque to the public as well as those who report the news. However, we know that users’ interactions matter, clicks matter. We know that word choice and image choice make a difference – and it’s not less is more. People click more on vivid or graphic language and photos. But that doesn’t mean that’s what’s best for everyone. Remember when it [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For our brainstorm, we decided to try to solve around: &#8220;How Might We make COVID-19 news less anxiety producing?&#8221; Our simplest idea was what many people have found most effective &#8212; that is limiting their media consumption to certain times of day and certain lengths of time so as not to become overwhelmed. Our wildest idea was thinking about what it was about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that so many people find to be [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ve had insomnia on and off for years and recently it’s been on. (Hence my delay on this assignment, for which I publicly apologize!) I don’t have a sleep tracker, so tracking my media had an interesting side benefit of forcing me to reckon with how few hours of my days and nights are &#8220;unmediated.&#8221; My Netflix consumption over the course of the week all happened between the hours of 9 or 10 p.m. and [&#8230;]]]></description>
