					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Many platforms that enable connection and bonding despite physical location already exist; separately, many music streaming services are already in operation. However, few platforms bridge the gap between music and social connection, despite the many opportunities for bonding and sociability that music can create. In order to bridge this gap between music and social connection via distance, we propose an extension to Spotify which allows multiple users to stream the same playlist of songs [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The current COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered every facet of daily life as we know it. Unemployment in the U.S. is at a record high; schools, churches, and all social gatherings have been cancelled until further notice; even going outside for a walk requires careful consideration (Will I be able to stay 6 feet away from others? Do I have something I could fashion into a mask?). Times such as these are nearly unprecedented (certainly [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For our breakout session brainstorm, we began thinking about ideas of building community through music during a time of isolation. Specifically, we began thinking about how many of the U.S.&#8217;s most popular music festivals &#8211; Coachella, Bonnaroo, Hangout, and many others &#8211; have been either postponed or outright cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic. So, we began to brainstorm: How might we create a space for would-be festival goers to &#8220;congregate&#8221; for a [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s a truth known by nearly every uterus-owning human in the world: From the time you’re twelve (or so) years old, you can expect your Aunt Flo to come for a visit around once a month. In Western culture, the female period is often something simultaneously celebrated and shamed: A mother may exult her daughter’s transition into womanhood as she teaches her to use her first menstrual product, yet high schoolers giggle or cringe when [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While collecting data for my media diary, I was struck by the realization that more often than not, I&#8217;m consuming media while I&#8217;m doing something else &#8211; eating dinner, washing the dishes, walking to class. Even more, I noticed that I&#8217;ll often consume media while I&#8217;m consuming another type of media. This chart reflects the myriad ways I like to consume media, often concurrently. The numbers below the media reflect the total hours spent consuming/producing [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I’ll admit that from the moment I saw this assignment on the syllabus, I was dreading the day I would have to switch off my phone and survive in the world “unplugged” for a day. Of course, I still had my laptop, but I knew ahead of time that my phone really comprised the bulk of how I work, play, and communicate in a day. Going phoneless would mean a day without scrolling through Instagram, [&#8230;]]]></description>
