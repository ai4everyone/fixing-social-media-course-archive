					<description><![CDATA[Quick Recap: As explored as part of my Case Study: Comparative Observations of Online Spaces for Cooking, “Despite the apparent lack of it in social media, civility in discourse is a crucial part of democratic deliberation and a critical symbol of “a developed democratic society.”(1) A unique case study on a corner of the internet where almost all comments are constructive and dare I say it, funny, can be found in the comments section of [&#8230;]]]></description>

Rather, the transmissions in question are recipes. Online spaces for cooking are reminiscent of the early days of the internet; when most of online interaction was just about reveling in the simple joy of meeting others who are also interested in whatever topic you [&#8230;]]]></description>

I recorded snippets of my &#8220;IRL&#8221; activity and included bursts of messages and calls that pulled me away from the present. In my visualization, I feature &#8220;IRL&#8221; moments of my week that felt fun, spontaneous and &#8220;connected&#8221;; moments that felt shared with others.
