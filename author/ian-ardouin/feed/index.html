In this way, while protests are subversive, they are also integral to democracy in expressing opinions, desires and demanding accountability.

					<description><![CDATA[Street protest is a potent form of direct action, used across history and geography as a tool for progress and social justice. Because of its radical nature, it is always at odds with power, and is constantly threatened by repression. It is even more vulnerable in the current state of affairs, as it has been rendered impractical by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global quarantine experienced all over the world. But there are countless causes [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During our group design session, we spent time thinking about the following question: how might we celebrate and protect people&#8217;s identity on social media to reduce cultural biases and stereotypes? Our simplest idea: require from social media feeds to include a ratio of users coming from other countries or cultural backgrounds. Our wildest idea: create a virtual reality experience that lets people experience life with an identity that&#8217;s not their own. During our group design [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please check out the live demo. Over the course of seven days, I recorded a data point each time I engaged with published content for ~10 seconds or more. This visualization groups those many pieces of content based on their provenance (e.g content that I deliberately access versus content recommended by algorithms). Each piece of media is represented by a rectangle, and its size is based on the time I spent with it. The resulting [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The assignment was off to a not-so-great start. I had committed to entirely cut my internet access for a duration of 24 hours, and I was already bargaining with myself to delay the experiment. There was this Really Important Phone Call I had to make, and it already felt like I had to bend the rules.
