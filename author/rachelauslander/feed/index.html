					<description><![CDATA[“To read Rookie was to be seen and to find a place where perhaps the most affirming comment section on the Internet empathized with conflicting feelings. Through personal stories, illustrations, photo essays, interviews, and experimental media, young people’s formative insights into identity and growing up were treated with validity and care instead of condescension and preachiness.

					<description><![CDATA[By Jess Eng and Rachel Auslander The comment section needs a makeover. Readers today often comment on news articles or videos without thinking twice about what they write, or considering whether their comments will stifle productive conversations. Comment sections often have no filter, which leads to an abundance of trolls and angry commentators. In an open comment space without direction for what the user should think about when commenting, the potential for context collapse is [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I didn’t think that the 24 hour challenge would be that difficult since I would be able to (and was planning on) using my laptop during the challenge.
