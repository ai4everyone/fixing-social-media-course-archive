					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea that there&#039;s a group designated as responders to news as it exists, because there&#039;s certainly responses to news as published by folks all around the ideological spectrum. I don&#039;t know whether conservatives responding to the NYT is as broad a spectrum as you might want - corners of my ideological bubble specialize in complaining how conservative the Times is. Perhaps there are a couple of projects where you invite folks to the right and left of the content to react to different sources? I worry that asking people to respond to everything is a recipe for overload and overreaction - is there a way to ask responders to pick one thing they thought the source they&#039;re following got wrong that day? And maybe a counterbalance of something they feel the publication got right? Stories that one side grudgingly accepts could be a really interesting news feed. Excited to see where you go with this.]]></description>
