					<description><![CDATA[Love the idea of a deeply limited, special purpose social network - exactly the sort of thinking I was hoping the course would inspire. I think the design as proposed is brilliant - I don&#039;t think you need much interrogation of it. But I would recommend you prototype it using existing tools. Can you ask a community of folks to do it with you over email and see their reactions over time? Would be amazing to get some feedback from a lightweight prototype and then consider building it for real. The practice you propose is interesting above and beyond an ap - try the practice even if you don&#039;t build the app!]]></description>
