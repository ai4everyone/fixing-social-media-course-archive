					<description><![CDATA[Ian, I love the observation that with physical space closing, we need spaces for protest. That seems absolutely right to me and very much worth exploring. I think Mols Sauter has done some of the best work on DDoS and ethics in &quot;The Coming Swarm&quot; and I highly recommend reading it. What you&#039;re proposing technically sounds a lot like Third Voice, a browser plugin from 1999 - there&#039;s rich thinking around whether someone has the right to annotate your website, to react to it, and to be copresent in the space you&#039;ve created. I am excited to see where you go with this, but would urge you to be sure you engage not just with the morality of DDoS, but with questions like artist&#039;s rights - does anyone have the right to speak alongside or over your speech?]]></description>
