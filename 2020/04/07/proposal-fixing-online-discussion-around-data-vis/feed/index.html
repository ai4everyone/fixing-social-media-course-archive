					<description><![CDATA[This is a terrific, well-bounded problem to tackle. It might be especially good to identify a community, like r/dataisbeautiful, to use as alpha users and to interview before you start building. I like the idea of a space that allows people to use a template and create their own visualization with it - the model of the Python notebook might be one you want to consider as a model for building this system. I would recommend trying some early experiments - can you structure a discourse around a visualization that participants can reproduce on an existing community like r/dataisbeautiful, collect results on what people said and did and use it to iterate your design?]]></description>
