					<description><![CDATA[Romy, I think talking about the shape of the city is a fascinating and perhaps very constructive way of avoiding traditional political positioning in Lebanon. Like Alexis, I think the idea of producing images that can be items for discussion is a powerful one. I wonder whether the way you&#039;re presenting these questions is a bit too constrained - you&#039;re asking mostly about vehicles and surveillance; is there a broader range of topics you can include? Could people prioritize which topics they found most important, as in Lebanonacracia? Is there some way of including some more open ended input - what do you imagine your city looking/feeling like? What do you most want/least want?]]></description>
