					<description><![CDATA[Excited to see you exploring the idea of offline as well as online connection. I think there&#039;s lots to be said for helping people make real-world friends - there&#039;s good literature on how loneliness affects adults, and how men in particular are having a hard time maintaining friendships in middle age. I need more details about the ways this platform will be specifically implemented. Are you proposing an activity you want to do, and soliciting someone to come do it with you? Is that really different from MeetUp? How do you deal with ideas of safety and security in this model - women in particular may be reluctant to meet someone they know nothing about for, say, urban exploration. I&#039;d love to see you think through these details, particularly the safety details, and put something forward as I think there&#039;s something really intriguing about meeting new people in the physical world, not just online. Maybe there&#039;s a more involved meeting online, leading to a physical meetup and then a return to online?]]></description>
