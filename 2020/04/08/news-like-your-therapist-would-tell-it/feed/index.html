					<description><![CDATA[The intention behind this is extremely worthwhile - being overwhelmed by news is a real thing, and having someone thoughtfully curate the day&#039;s news is a very reasonable response to the phenomenon. I was initially going to complain that this is a &quot;fixing the news&quot; intervention, not a &quot;fixing social media&quot; one, but the two have merged to the point where that distinction isn&#039;t always helpful. You might consider something that greys out news stories on your social media and reminds you to read your newsletter instead.

A key to doing this well as a project is going to be actually DOING it. Not necessarily the A/B testing, but certainly doing a demo newsletter with real news and links to show the tone. Excited to see it.]]></description>
