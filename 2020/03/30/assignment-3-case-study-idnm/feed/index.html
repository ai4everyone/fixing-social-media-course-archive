					<description><![CDATA[I deeply appreciate the chance I had to learn about a movement that was not widely covered in the US. I see many ways in which Idle No More reflects a new form of organizing that we&#039;re seeing: highly decentralized with social media as a way of communicating between participants; a demand to be taken seriously and given attention by mainstream media; a relationship between online and real world actions. What was less clear to me was whether this was an offline movement that used social media well, or an example of an online community. It would be great to hear you explore a bit further the ways in which online spaces enabled connections and relationships that would have been unlikely to form offline, and thoughts on whether this movement was especially healthy in its online presence.]]></description>
