					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m envious of your COVID mom group - I could use a bit more insight on how to keep my ten year old both busy and sane. It&#039;s interesting to think about the line between &quot;real world&quot; and online groups in a case like this. The physical location suggests that this is a group that might meet face to face in a post-COVID moment. Do you have a sense for whether participants know each other in person? Was it difficult for you to join from outside the US originally? I think the affordances - the moderation, the invitation - are clearly helpful, but it feels like the social norms - no Pinterest moms - are at least part of what&#039;s helpful. It might be interesting to explore the affordances versus norms question in thinking about how healthy communities come about.]]></description>
