					<description><![CDATA[Digital influencers are a fascinating phenomenon, and absolutely worth examination. It&#039;s interesting to me that the healthiest of the communities you mention here is one you only scratch the surface of - Hakune Mitsu.

Or is it the (very small) community of people who are creating these presences and interacting them with one another? It&#039;s a fascinating place to dig, but I&#039;d love to see more work exploring where an individual artist&#039;s creation ends and community begins.]]></description>
