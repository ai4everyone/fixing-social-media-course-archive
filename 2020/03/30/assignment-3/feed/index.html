					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for helping us understand Xiachufang, which doesn&#039;t appear to have a clear parallel in the US. The integration with grocery delivery and cooking equipment suppliers is particularly unusual to US audiences... and a good example of how many Chinese platforms are vertically integrated. I like your approach of offering suggestions for how Xiachufang could improve, but it would be helpful to hear more about what you think they are already doing well. It sounds like you&#039;re impressed with the ways Xiachufang is reaching out to inexperienced cooks - do you think it is connecting them to each other, or do they feel more connected to the app than to the broader community? It would be helpful to explore that in considering this as a community case study.]]></description>
