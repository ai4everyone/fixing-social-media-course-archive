					<description><![CDATA[Val, you picked a fascinating and potentially transformational time for this community. The South End is transforming quickly, and lots of the folks living there are more closely tied to their occupations than to their neighbors most of the time. COVID-19 is forcing a sense of awareness of neighborhood that would otherwise be unlikely. I feel like we&#039;re watching the opening chapters of a play in your case study, and I would be fascinated to see whether the community remains as high functioning during this strange and transformative time. I appreciated your quantitative analysis and the close reading of posts - the drop in &quot;truthy&quot;ness is concerning, but hardly unexpected given current circumstances. Thanks for a glimpse of a very interesting local community in a time of transformation.]]></description>
