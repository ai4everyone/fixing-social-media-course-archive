					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for such a thoughtful and loving look at a community that clearly means a lot to you personally. The analogy to a boy&#039;s dormitory is a very apt one - it&#039;s a warm and safe space for the boys who live there, but likely a very unfriendly space for outsiders, particularly women. I wonder whether this is a defining feature of a community - there are insiders and outsiders and you are one or the other? I also found it very interesting to see the technical affordances, like the admissions quiz, that make HUPU unique. Finally, I&#039;m very interested in the ways in which this community has maintained its identity and traditions while remaining small in the face of competition - it would be great to know a bit more about ownership and structure to understand how this has come about and how it&#039;s remained special over all these years.]]></description>
