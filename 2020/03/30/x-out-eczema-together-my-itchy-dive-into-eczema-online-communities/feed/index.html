					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s really wonderful to think of the eczema community as being one that crosses platforms, from Reddit to Imgur to Zoom. I think this is a great example of a community whose most natural manifestation might be online, where there&#039;s sufficient people who share the condition to provide insight and support. I appreciate the quantitative analysis, but wonder whether it would have been informative to compare with another health community and get a sense for whether the dynamics you&#039;re seeing in the eczema community are especially healthy - perhaps based on the need for psychological support around the disease - versus another community like diabetes, for instance. Thanks for sharing your own story in exploring this - appreciate the openness and honesty.]]></description>
