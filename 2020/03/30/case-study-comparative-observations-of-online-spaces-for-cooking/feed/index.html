					<description><![CDATA[This is a really excellent piece of work. You&#039;ve identified two case studies that share a common purpose and a moment in time - cooking during COVID - and done an excellent job of identifying the ways a platform designed for one sort of conversation supports other kinds of conversation. I&#039;m curious as to whether there&#039;s more to learn in this case study from contrast. Did you find significant differences between the NYT and Xiachufang? Does the fact that NYTimes is a closed (and pricey!) community lead to different dynamics than more open communities? I&#039;ll also be interested to see whether these communities transform at al after we are no longer distancing - is this a moment in time or a deeper dynamic made possible by cooking as a deeply emotional practice? Great work.]]></description>
