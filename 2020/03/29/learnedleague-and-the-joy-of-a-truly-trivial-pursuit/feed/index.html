					<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of a community that&#039;s deeply engaging to people involved, but in which people are not becoming friends. It&#039;s a great way of disrupting the idea that social networks are about discovering and befriending other people. Some are, some aren&#039;t - this one is about a wonderfully geeky form of competition. Good analysis of the ways in which the particular norms and affordances shape this space. I&#039;d love to see you dig in a bit more on why you think the boards in this space are so especially toxic. In a community that otherwise seems healthy, what is it about that form of interaction that fails so wildly?]]></description>
