					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for sharing a community that I would not otherwise have known about. I&#039;m particularly struck by the fact that a community has a high degree of anonymity and also a high degree of support, likely because of the subject matter and the common experiences of the women participating. I appreciate the tensions you identified within an otherwise healthy community. I think it&#039;s helpful to recognize that even the healthiest of communities are going to have problems that recur - the existence of FAQs actually stems from questions people got sick of answering in Usenet groups. I&#039;m fascinated that conversations like abortion can unfold in this group without splitting it apart. Do you have a sense for the moderation or other structures that keep the community from occasionally spiraling out of control?]]></description>
