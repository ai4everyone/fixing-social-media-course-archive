					<description><![CDATA[This is a lovely case study on a community that is quite unlike what we might encounter on social media today. It&#039;s clear that the website has a specific aesthetics and limitations and is not necessarily aiming to reach a super broad audience -- I think you summed this up nicely: &quot;It was written for the community that knew where to find it and would be excited to receive it.” I&#039;m curious if, over time, it became harder for Rookie to maintain their vision as the publication expanded and started to have a presence on social media platforms like Instagram. Did broadening their reach onto other platforms weaken the community they had cultivated on their website?

It&#039;s also interesting how the community isn&#039;t sustained through driving connections/interactions with other people directly, but rather, through creating a collective online space for personal growth and thinking. It&#039;s nice to recognize that a strong sense of community can be shared without necessarily having direct interactions with one another.

Overall this was a really well-written case study that raised compelling questions for me about what constitutes an online community and how different design decisions can nourish a healthy one. (It also made me nostalgic because I, too, used to read Rookie!)]]></description>
