					<description><![CDATA[Really impressed with the work you did to narrow in on this problem space of online commenting. You present a strong argument for visual commenting, particularly identifying painpoints and needs from interviewing the Quantified Self speaker and surveying platforms like the Upshot.

I also think the work you did to test the tool in practice was great. Even though you weren&#039;t able to test the tool as much directly in r/dataisbeautiful, I thought the workaround of creating your own subreddit and conducting usability tests there was great. I am curious about a before/after comparison of how participants felt or engaged differently using vizdat vs. without using vizdat.

It&#039;s been awesome to see this project come together -- it&#039;s a really well-thought tool and hope it might game some traction in the data viz community! I could also see vizdat being really useful in educational settings, perhaps also in communities like Stack Exchange, where people might go to more directly ask questions and seek help around creating data visualizations. I also love the future idea of using a game to publicize and test the tool in existing data viz subreddits.]]></description>
