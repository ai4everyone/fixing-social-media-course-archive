					<description><![CDATA[I thought this project thoughtfully balanced considerations of maintaining both an online and offline community. While it originally was aimed at finding a way to connect the online HUPU community in person, I thought features like the short TikTok videos were a creative way to also sustain this connection through continued online community. I could see that being a really popular feature on a pick up basketball app.

The notion of incorporating the credit system into things like basketball rentals was really compelling. My only question around this is how users might be able to &quot;game&quot; a system like this. How might you prevent users from being dishonest or doing things just to gain credits?

Overall, I thought this project did a great job of focusing on an existing community and identifying opportunities to foster both online and offline connections in the basketball community!]]></description>
