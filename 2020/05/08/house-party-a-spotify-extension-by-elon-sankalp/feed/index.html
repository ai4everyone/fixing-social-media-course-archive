					<description><![CDATA[I love how timely this project is and the original inspiration from a spontaneous virtual dance party. I thought you did a really solid job of surveying existing social platforms and music platforms and presenting a strong argument for a tool like House Party. Even though you didn&#039;t build the tool, you clearly researched the existing technical infrastructure and features of Spotify and provided some really compelling use cases for how the tool could be used. I also appreciated how you included potential metrics for success -- something that often isn&#039;t addressed in speculative design projects.

One thought I had was that the negative implications of echo chambers and bad actors aren’t as clear on platforms like Spotify (vs. platforms like Facebook). But I do wonder about other implications for the field of music curation — specifically for “expert” curators, like DJs. Would their jobs become obsolete as everyone becomes their own DJ? Or would this change what kinds of music become influential?

Overall a creative and well-researched project (and love the idea of the class Spotify playlist!).]]></description>
