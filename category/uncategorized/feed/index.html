					<description><![CDATA[Designed by Emma Ogiemwanye and Kelly Wagman The Temple to the Cyborg Goddess is a sacred space online for diverse technologist artists to gather and share ideas about visions for the future of media. The space steps outsides dominant frameworks of social media design by embracing various forms of engagement not driven by profit and attention. Community activities include livestream gatherings, interactive virtual exhibits, and other forms of collective building and imagining. Read our manifesto [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[“To read Rookie was to be seen and to find a place where perhaps the most affirming comment section on the Internet empathized with conflicting feelings. Through personal stories, illustrations, photo essays, interviews, and experimental media, young people’s formative insights into identity and growing up were treated with validity and care instead of condescension and preachiness. Rookie cultivated a rare space where readers could examine what it means to be a person in their own [&#8230;]]]></description>

In this way, while protests are subversive, they are also integral to democracy in expressing opinions, desires and demanding accountability.

					<description><![CDATA[Abstract Many platforms that enable connection and bonding despite physical location already exist; separately, many music streaming services are already in operation. However, few platforms bridge the gap between music and social connection, despite the many opportunities for bonding and sociability that music can create. In order to bridge this gap between music and social connection via distance, we propose an extension to Spotify which allows multiple users to stream the same playlist of songs [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Summary So much discussion is happening these days that is backed up with data visualization (charts or graphs), but the problem is, misinformation and trust issues could arise due to the fact that these visualizations are not fully understood, or can’t be reproduced to more accurate versions unless the author of the chart decides to do so.  In this work, I explored simple and lightweight workflows to democratize the process of discussing data on the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Update: 22nd of April (due to progression of project) Findings on Lebanocracia.org case study After interviewing users of Lebanocracia.org around the possibility of transforming the platform into an topic based open-discussion, most were reluctant because they didn&#8217;t imagine how that could change the close mindedness of Lebanese citizens: they thought that people would share their opinion with little intention of changing it even if other people&#8217;s point of view is equally shared.

					<description><![CDATA[The algorithms that social media and search engines use to elevate news stories are opaque to the public as well as those who report the news. However, we know that users’ interactions matter, clicks matter. We know that word choice and image choice make a difference – and it’s not less is more. People click more on vivid or graphic language and photos. But that doesn’t mean that’s what’s best for everyone. Remember when it [&#8230;]]]></description>
