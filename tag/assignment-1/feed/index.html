					<description><![CDATA[Offline is the new luxury. Probably a cliché phrase by now, but it does feel like this considering the logistics needed to spend 24 hours without my phone in the middle of the week. Before even starting, the question is when is a good time? I work, I have two small kids, a husband, an attempt at some social life, and an array of family and friends living in different parts of the world which [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Introduction As a part of our Fixing Social Media course, we were asked to go without our phones for a period of 24 hours and record our reflections afterwards. The goal was to have a better understanding of how we relate to our phones and determine whether that relationship could be described as an addiction or in some other terms. I don’t perceive myself as being very glued to my phone, so I was particularly [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is my third time doing a technology / media / internet fast, and I learn something new each time. This time, I was surprised by how much more prepared I had to be for events and things that I had during my day. For example, instead of budgeting my time within a 5 minute window, I had to board the T with more like a 15-minute window, in order to ensure that I arrived [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#8217;s more like: No Personal Assistant Day! No alarm, no reminders, no directions, no weather or time info. In fact, no real time info of any sort. I&#8217;m relying on my laptop, and my good old friends; paper and pen! I spent 24 hours without my phone. In this blog post I will take you through my reflection on the experience. It wasn&#8217;t smooth sailing, and I actually failed at first but managed to choose [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;m (un?)lucky enough to have already spent a recent day without my phone &#8211; left in the backseat of an Uber and turned off within minutes of my disembarkation &#8211; so I felt like a relative phone-free pro going into this assignment. Before I turned off my phone on Wednesday night, I already knew which apps would be most usable from my laptop vs. iPad, and to enable iMessage from my email instead of just [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I chose Monday, February 17, to be the day I went without my phone for 24 hours. Sunday night before I went to bed, I set my phone in the other room and didn’t pick it up again until Tuesday morning. It was quite the enlightening experience. The funny part is that during the 24 hours, the biggest things I missed weren’t the things I do most on my phone but were the basic utility [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Before going to bed, I informed my family and friends that I won’t be easily reachable the next day. I also took out my watch that I hadn’t been using since I received an apple watch for Christmas – figured I would need to know the time as I walk around campus. As I was falling asleep, I thought that keeping my phone charged next to my bed (because I needed an alarm) and starting [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The assignment was off to a not-so-great start. I had committed to entirely cut my internet access for a duration of 24 hours, and I was already bargaining with myself to delay the experiment. There was this Really Important Phone Call I had to make, and it already felt like I had to bend the rules. For my defense, I was meant to check in with my partner, who had been navigating immigration issues from [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it’s worth noting that I tried doing this assignment 4 times before I finally succeeded. I finally succeeded on Feb 17 to Feb 18 (Tuesday before this was due…I cut it close). I kept feeling the need to text or message or call about a thing, order a Lyft or look up directions, etc — all things that broke the cycle in previous attempts. I wanted to do a full 24 hours, so [&#8230;]]]></description>
