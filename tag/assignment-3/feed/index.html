					<description><![CDATA[Miquela Sousa (@lilmiquela), Shudu (@shudu.gram), and Audy Bleu (@audy.bleu) are social media bots, but not the kind made by the thousands to bestow large quantities of likes on divisive posts. They are carefully crafted CGI characters, two of whom were assumed to be human before their creators opened up about their origin. They are most active on Instagram, although Miquela also releases music available on Spotify. They are also influencers. As of this writing, Miquela [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s hard to say that HUPU is a successful online community. As one of the oldest Chinese online sports BBS community. HUPU was founded by Dr. Hang Cheng in Chicago in 2004 which was the year after Yao Ming entered NBA. The original name of HUPU was &#8220;hoopChina&#8221; which reinforced its function as an online basketball forum. After 16 years of its establishment, HUPU still hasn&#8217;t obtained the right to broadcast NBA games. Compared to [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[And suddenly, everybody got my life. Everything is going online thanks to the COVID-19 pandemia. Okay, I may be exaggerating a little bit, but in a way it seems like it. I’ve left my home country for good more than ten years ago, leaving my family and lifelong friends behind a screen. I’ve been working completely remote for almost a decade too, with a virtual team in different timezones.&#160; Online weddings? Ours was not online, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[NOTE: I have left all names in screenshots as the South End Community Board is a public, visible group on facebook. It’s hard to ignore the growth of Facebook Groups, whether you’re an active Facebook user or just a lucky consumer of the widespread “More Together” ad campaign. As of April 2019, more than 400 million people were in groups that they found meaningful (as determined by Facebook through surveys and engagement metrics).[1] It would [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s a truth known by nearly every uterus-owning human in the world: From the time you’re twelve (or so) years old, you can expect your Aunt Flo to come for a visit around once a month. In Western culture, the female period is often something simultaneously celebrated and shamed: A mother may exult her daughter’s transition into womanhood as she teaches her to use her first menstrual product, yet high schoolers giggle or cringe when [&#8230;]]]></description>
