					<description><![CDATA[I discovered a temporal quality to my media consumption. Above, I show word clouds for different parts of my day along with the corresponding media I use. Larger font size correlates with higher use. I also couldn&#8217;t help the urge to Instagram-ify the media chart as a kind of meta-commentary about creating media about our media. I specifically chose to use &#8220;millennial pink&#8221; and plants in the final piece and ran the photo through the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hoped to track my media consumption this week as seamlessly as possible. To achieve this goal, I sorted through a list of options in the Chrome Extension store and ultimately installed Webtime Tracker. This app tracked the hours I spent on websites from my Chrome browser. I had never done something like this so I was excited to see the outcomes from one week&#8217;s worth. Using the aggregated data from the past seven days, [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My data was tracked during a busy week with my work. I am sure the story and insights from my data will change depending on the timing. For this exercise I turned on data tracking for my activities by google services. I also used the data logged through my iOS devices. For the visualizations I used vizd.at a data vis tool in beta mode that is mostly aimed for discussing interactive data online. Hover over [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For my media diary, I chose to track all of my consumption of media that were readable or audible artifacts intended to be seen or heard outside of 1-1 communications (i.e. iMessages were not counted, but email newsletters were). From there, I translated each hour (roughly) of my media consumption into a one-count movement fundamental, so that each day could be represented with three eight-counts of dance. I chose to perform my dance to the [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For the past week, I wrote down every day my media consumption, but also my daily mental state (as I always do). I spoke on the phone and checked compulsively instagram&#62;whatsapp&#62;mail. I also lost my phone and lasted a day without checking my mail. I went into spirals of stalking people in Tech companies on LinkedIn, and binge-listened to a podcast. I also ordered 3 books. I want to understand what is causing these different [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Please check out the live demo. Over the course of seven days, I recorded a data point each time I engaged with published content for ~10 seconds or more. This visualization groups those many pieces of content based on their provenance (e.g content that I deliberately access versus content recommended by algorithms). Each piece of media is represented by a rectangle, and its size is based on the time I spent with it. The resulting [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While collecting data for my media diary, I was struck by the realization that more often than not, I&#8217;m consuming media while I&#8217;m doing something else &#8211; eating dinner, washing the dishes, walking to class. Even more, I noticed that I&#8217;ll often consume media while I&#8217;m consuming another type of media. This chart reflects the myriad ways I like to consume media, often concurrently. The numbers below the media reflect the total hours spent consuming/producing [&#8230;]]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[During the week-long span from Sunday, February 16, to Saturday, February 22, I recorded all of the media that I consumed in a &#8220;media diary.&#8221; The way I defined media was anything that portrayed information or entertainment to me through a screen, text, or audio source. Note that I did not include in-person interactions as media so long as they were free from the use of technology to enhance the conversation/interaction. This exercise taught me [&#8230;]]]></description>
